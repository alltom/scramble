Know these these games?

  Boggle:
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle
  Scramble:
    http://apps.facebook.com/scramblegame/

The goal: to always win, by cheating.
  I have proven that it works, so please don't trust my ranking.

USAGE:
  Just type the letters on the board
  All white-space is ignored.
  "qu" is considered a single letter.
  If the board isn't 4x4, edit the code (see the bottom).

EXAMPLE:
  $ ruby scramble.rb
  aega
  mquru
  eepl
  tcrt
  ^D
  ame
  cee
  aer
  eme
  cep
  era
  ere
  tee
  tec
  erg
  ...

The well-written parts of the code were inspired by Jim Weirich's sudoku solver:
